# Auto-Injetor 🤖🚀

An advanced and universal Tampermonkey script that automates lesson progress and intelligently solves assessments on modern E-Learning platforms like Unicte, Noz, and Cademi.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Auto-Advance:** Detects and skips lessons that have already been completed.
- **Video Bypass (Iframes and Native):** Bypasses video players like Vimeo, YouTube, and PandaVideo, instantly simulating that the video has been watched to the end.
- **Multi-Threaded Quiz Solver:** 
  - Maps multiple questions on a single screen.
  - For Multiple-Choice quizzes: Identifies correct answers by color feedback (green = correct, red = try again) and learns the correct answer autonomously in an asynchronous way.
  - For Checkbox Challenges: Uses asynchronous brute-force to discover the exact combinations in quizzes that require "multiple correct answers".
- **Ghost Writer:** Identifies open-ended essay text boxes in assessments and fills them natively, bypassing React blocks.
- **500ms Radar System:** Does not rely on page reloads. The bot reacts in real-time within the SPA (Single Page Application) architecture.
